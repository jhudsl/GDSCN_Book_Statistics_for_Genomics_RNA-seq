## AnVIL Template

Based on [_Open-source Tools for Training Resources (OTTR)_](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template)

The purpose of this template and is to make publishing maintenance for AnVIL content across multiple different platforms _less painful_.

_This template helps you_:   

- Edit and write an AnVIL course in [RMarkdown files](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and have it published to multiple different platforms:
  - [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/bookstore?type=course)
  - [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/)
  - [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
- Have [Github action robots](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/wiki/How-to-set-up-and-customize-GitHub-actions-robots) do your repetitive tasks like spell check and re-rendering. 
- Use [automagic conversion](https://github.com/jhudsl/ottrpal) to ease the lift of prepping the material for different platforms' formats.
- Use [our Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jhudsl/course_template) for consistency across authors as well as to help you [avoid dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell).

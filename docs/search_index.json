All activities will be run using RStudio, so if you choose, you can use a different RStudio interface (such as RStudio Cloud or locally installed RStudio). The Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) is a scalable and interoperable computing resource for the genomics scientific community. AnVIL enables researchers to analyze high-value open and controlled access genomic datasets with popular analysis tools in a secure cloud computing environment. AnVIL also serves as a data commons. It runs on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and is sponsored by NHGRI. In addition to Docker-based analysis workflows, AnVIL supports popular interactive analysis tools such as Jupyter notebooks, Bioconductor, RStudio, and Galaxy. By operating in the cloud, AnVIL users can scale analyses from a single computer to thousands and securely share data, workflows, and reproducible results with collaborators and colleagues. 3.2 Step 1: Create a Google Account AnVIL uses Terra to run analyses. Terra operates on Google Cloud Platform, so you’ll need a Google account to make sure your instructor can keep track of any computing costs you accrue. If you do not already have a Google account that you would like to use for accessing Terra, create one now. Otherwise, please use a Gmail account you have already set up. If you would like to create a Google account that is associated with your non-Gmail, institutional email address, follow these instructions. 3.3 Step 2: Sign in to Terra You need to sign into Terra with your Google account to allow your instructor to add you to projects and/or Workspaces associated with your specific class. This is the only way you can launch applications and perform computations on AnVIL. Launch Terra, and you should be prompted to sign in with your Google account. You can always access Terra by going to anvil.terra.bio, or by clicking the link on the AnVIL home page. 3.4 Step 3: Share your ID It is very important that you share the Google account you used above with your instructor! Otherwise, they cannot add you to class projects or Workspaces.

These disorders result from mutations in genes responsible for epigenetic machinery. In other words, genes responsible for controlling the epigenome lose their normal function. Despite having different causative genes, these disorders share similarities in disease presentation. This physical similarity, or phenotypic convergence, could be due to these mutations causing similar effects at the epigenomic level. Such epigenetic changes then lead to similarities gene expression. Scientists at Johns Hopkins designed an experiment to identify abnormalities shared across multiple MDEMs, in order to causally relate epigenetic variation to disease phenotypes. As part of this experiment, scientists examined gene expression (RNA-Seq) states from mouse models of three MDEMs (Kabuki types 1&amp;2 and Rubinstein-Taybi syndromes). You can find out more about this experiment here. 4.2 Using GEOquery The NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is an international public repository that archives and freely distributes microarray, next-generation sequencing, and other forms of high-throughput functional genomics data submitted by the research community. We will use the Bioconductor package GEOquery to load data from GEO. Using GEOquery is convenient because it allows us to get the data programmatically without having to download anything manually. This ensures anyone following in our footsteps can follow what we did exactly. First, install GEOquery and load the library using the following code. if you are asked to update packages, you can type ‘n’ for ‘no’. # Install and load GEOquery BiocManager::install(&quot;GEOquery&quot;) library(GEOquery) 4.3 GEOquery Record Types GEO contains several different record types. The most straightforward is a ‘Sample’ record. A Sample record describes the conditions under which an individual Sample was handled, the manipulations it underwent, and the abundance measurement of each element derived from it. Each Sample record is assigned a unique and stable GEO accession number (GSMxxx). A Sample entity may be included in multiple ‘Series’. a ‘Series’ record defines a set of related Samples considered to be part of a group. This record describes how the Samples are related and provides information about the experiment. Series records may also contain tables describing extracted data, summary conclusions, or analyses. Each Series record is assigned a unique and stable GEO accession number (GSExxx). We need to locate the correct ‘Series’ number for this experiment. 4.4 Kabuki Dataset Metadata We will use the getGEO() function to locate the experiment’s data using the Series record number. # Indicate which Series to download gse &lt;- getGEO(&quot;GSE162176&quot;) The output from getGEO() on a Series record type is a list of objects called an ExpressionSet. In our case, there is only one ExpressionSet, so we can select the first item (the data) from the list using brackets. # Select the first item in the list exp_set &lt;- gse[[1]] We can look at the ExpressionSet metadata using pData(). # Extract phenotypic data pheno_data &lt;- pData(exp_set) names(pheno_data) ## [1] &quot;title&quot; &quot;geo_accession&quot; ## [3] &quot;status&quot; &quot;submission_date&quot; ## [5] &quot;last_update_date&quot; &quot;type&quot; ## [7] &quot;channel_count&quot; &quot;source_name_ch1&quot; ## [9] &quot;organism_ch1&quot; &quot;characteristics_ch1&quot; ## [11] &quot;characteristics_ch1.1&quot; &quot;characteristics_ch1.2&quot; ## [13] &quot;characteristics_ch1.3&quot; &quot;molecule_ch1&quot; ## [15] &quot;extract_protocol_ch1&quot; &quot;extract_protocol_ch1.1&quot; ## [17] &quot;taxid_ch1&quot; &quot;description&quot; ## [19] &quot;data_processing&quot; &quot;data_processing.1&quot; ## [21] &quot;data_processing.2&quot; &quot;platform_id&quot; ## [23] &quot;contact_name&quot; &quot;contact_email&quot; ## [25] &quot;contact_laboratory&quot; &quot;contact_department&quot; ## [27] &quot;contact_institute&quot; &quot;contact_address&quot; ## [29] &quot;contact_city&quot; &quot;contact_state&quot; ## [31] &quot;contact_zip/postal_code&quot; &quot;contact_country&quot; ## [33] &quot;data_row_count&quot; &quot;instrument_model&quot; ## [35] &quot;library_selection&quot; &quot;library_source&quot; ## [37] &quot;library_strategy&quot; &quot;relation&quot; ## [39] &quot;relation.1&quot; &quot;supplementary_file_1&quot; ## [41] &quot;age (approximate):ch1&quot; &quot;cell type:ch1&quot; ## [43] &quot;disease state:ch1&quot; &quot;strain:ch1&quot; View the data to see which Samples are contained in this ExpressionSet. # Explore the metadata View(pheno_data) ## title geo_accession status ## GSM4944267 Kabuki syndrome type 1 rep 1 GSM4944267 Public on Aug 31 2021 ## GSM4944268 Kabuki syndrome type 1 rep 2 GSM4944268 Public on Aug 31 2021 ## GSM4944269 Kabuki syndrome type 1 rep 3 GSM4944269 Public on Aug 31 2021 ## GSM4944270 Kabuki syndrome type 1 rep 4 GSM4944270 Public on Aug 31 2021 ## GSM4944271 Kabuki syndrome type 1 rep 5 GSM4944271 Public on Aug 31 2021 ## submission_date last_update_date type ## GSM4944267 Nov 25 2020 Aug 31 2021 SRA ## GSM4944268 Nov 25 2020 Aug 31 2021 SRA ## GSM4944269 Nov 25 2020 Aug 31 2021 SRA ## GSM4944270 Nov 25 2020 Aug 31 2021 SRA ## GSM4944271 Nov 25 2020 Aug 31 2021 SRA 4.5 Recap QUESTION: Explore the metadata.
